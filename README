Detailed instructions on how to get Milestone 2 working For Project 1 CS490 

pip install tweepy(name of API)
# we need tweepy to gather tweets from Twitter

apply for twitter developer account once approved note down the consumer key, secret key, token, secret token

you don't want to put those keys in your main py file as anyone that has access to those keys can get access to your twitter account.

Solution: put all keys in an .env file and link them with the main py file (milestone1.py)

using os.environ put in all the keys to respective variables

Twitter uses OAuthHandler to authenticate keys make sure you import all necessary libraries
ex: tweepy, webbrowser, time flask, os, random, dotenv, join from os.path, OAuthHandler from tweepy, Cursor from tweepy, datetime, date, time, timeDelta from datetime

Now it's time create simple flask application

app = flask.Flask(__name__)
 
@app.route('/')

line 19 and line 21 create a simmple flask application

Now create a function where you implement all tweepy functions needed for milestone 1

create a list with 10 or so food items

using the random module choose a random item from the above list

Now using search function find all tweets related to that random item

You will receive thousands of tweets. Choose a random tweet by indexing a random number and that will be your tweet that you will display

use .created_at to find the time/date of when it was tweeted

use user.screen_name to find the screen name of who tweeted it

use user.name to find the actuall name of the person who tweeted it

use user.url to find the link of the tweet 

Make sure all above are stored in some variable

Now when returning for the function make sure to use flask.render_template() with index.html as the first parameter and the above variables just created followed by that

make sure to put var=var when doing it though for each one

ex: text = text,
    date = date,


/////// Index.html Info /////////

create proper html format

link CSS file using the link tag # More info on the CSS Part Below

Now those variables that you made in the .py file display them in the html by using {{ var }} with var == to whatever variable you need to put there


/// CSS info ///

Create separate CSS stylesheet make sure to put in a directory that is in the Project 1 Folder 

Use Below line to link CSS style sheet with HTML 

<link rel="stylesheet" href= {{ url_for('static',filename='style.css') }} />

for each parts of the html style however you like 

ex: 

body {

  some style
  
  
}

p {


  some style
  
}

# Things that I had trouble on

This is the first project where I really dived into API's other than the quick crash course that we had in class I didn't really have any idea on what an API really was before this project

In the beginning I was making too many API calls with Tweepy where I was being timed out. I worked around this as I would run the API once and then get the result and then focus on other things and comment 
out the API execution(putting it into a variable) and when everything was done I would uncomment out the API execution.

Next, was getting the images for the website. Now I know this was supposed to be one of the easiest parts of the project inputting images, but every command and python line I used wasn't working wget, urllib.request, withsource. I finally
was able to get around it by just putting the link to the website in the html img tag. See whenever I used wget or urllib.request it would block with the flask and create some problem.
